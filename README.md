A magic square is an arrangement of distinct numbers, usually integers, in a square grid, where the numbers in each row, 
and in each column, and the numbers in the main and secondary diagonals, all add up to the same number.

I create an application where the user input the size of the square and display it.
This application only works for odd square and if the numbers of the grid are greater than 1000,
the square are not  displayed correctly.
